Image of the 1999 Bridge Creekâ€“Moore tornado, which is the strongest tornado ever recorded, globally. It affected the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma metropolitan area.

### I wanted to see what features from a tornado predict  number of fatalities
* Data: This is a dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of all recorded tornados since 1951.

## Methods: 
* Model selection: Split data into test and train datasets and evaluate model performance by mean absolute error (MAE). 
* Evaluate performance of random forest (rf), gradient boosting (gb), and xgboosting (xgb) regressor models.  The rf regressor model had the least MAE.
* Tune hyperparamters of rf model via gridsearchcv
* Feature importance: Assess important features of the rf regressor model

## Findings:

* A tornado's magnitude was the most important feature in predicting number of fatalities from a tornado.
